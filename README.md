# Proton Pass

Search and manage your Proton Pass items directly from Raycast.

## Setup

This extension requires the Proton Pass CLI (`pass-cli`) to be installed and authenticated.

### 1. Install pass-cli

Download and install from [Proton Pass CLI Documentation](https://protonpass.github.io/pass-cli/).

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install protonmail/proton/pass-cli
```

### 2. Authenticate

Run the login command in your terminal:

```bash
pass-cli login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Proton account.

### 3. Verify

Test that the CLI is working:

```bash
pass-cli vault list
```

## Preferences

- **CLI Path**: Path to the `pass-cli` executable (defaults to `pass-cli` in PATH)
- **Default Password Length**: Length for generated passwords (default: 20)
- **Default Password Type**: Random characters or memorable passphrase
- **Transient Clipboard**: Clear password from clipboard after pasting

## Troubleshooting

### Keyring Access Issues

If you see keyring-related errors, try:

```bash
pass-cli logout --force
export PROTON_PASS_KEY_PROVIDER=fs
pass-cli login
```

### CLI Not Found

If the CLI is installed but not detected, set the full path in extension preferences:

```
/opt/homebrew/bin/pass-cli
```
